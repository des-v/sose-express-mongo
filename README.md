### Working with **env variables** and **.env** files
&nbsp;  
> Note: 
  > - We have automated for you the following step to make the copy from the **.env.example**:  
    > ```sh
    > cp .env.example .env
    > ```
  > - Please before starting the server uncomment and update the **.env** file values accordingly if necessary  
  &nbsp;  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

To add new *env variables*:   
  - Add them directly in the **.env** file

  - You can continue by editing the **class.puml** file   
  - Add additional **_*.puml_** files on that folder too.  
  &nbsp;
